        "This post is a super simple introduction to CUDA, the popular parallel computing platform and programming model from NVIDIA. I wrote a previous [“Easy Introduction”](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/easy-introduction-cuda-c-and-c/) to CUDA in 2013 that has been very popular over the years. But CUDA programming has gotten easier, and GPUs have gotten much faster, so it’s time for an updated (and even easier) introduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "CUDA C++ is just one of the ways you can create massively parallel applications with CUDA. It lets you use the powerful C++ programming language to develop high performance algorithms accelerated by thousands of parallel threads running on GPUs. Many developers have accelerated their computation- and bandwidth-hungry applications this way, including the libraries and frameworks that underpin the ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence known as [Deep Learning](https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning).\n",
        "\n",
        "So, you’ve heard about CUDA and you are interested in learning how to use it in your own applications. If you are a C or C++ programmer, this blog post should give you a good start. To follow along, you’ll need a computer with an CUDA-capable GPU (Windows, Mac, or Linux, and any NVIDIA GPU should do), or a cloud instance with GPUs (AWS, Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and other cloud service providers have them). You’ll also need the free [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installed.\n",

Figure 1 illustrates the the approach to indexing into an array (one-dimensional) in CUDA using `blockDim.x`, `gridDim.x`, and `threadIdx.x`. The idea is that each thread gets its index by computing the offset to the beginning of its block (the block index times the block size: `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x`) and adding the thread’s index within the block (`threadIdx.x`).
